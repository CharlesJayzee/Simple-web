    <h2>A classic American food</h2>

    <p>A dish consisting of a round patty of ground beef, or sometimes another savory ingredient, that is fried or grilled and typically served in a split bun or roll with various condiments and toppings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>Â½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        1.Form patties â€“ Separate the beef into 4 mounds, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers. Gently roll each mound into a ball (not firmly, we want tender patties not rock hard ones!) then press down into a patty that is slightly wider than the burger bun, to factor in cooking shrinkage.<br>
        2.Tip #1 â€“ Dent your patty in the middle. Thinning the centre of the patty compensates for the tendency of the patty to dome up in the middle as it cooks. It also reduces the overall patty shrinkage during cooking. Doing this means thereâ€™s no need to squash the burger to keep it flat and even as it cooks (losing precious juices!) Use your fingers or the back of your hand to press a dent into the centre of the patty. A neat trick I picked up from Bobby Flay many years ago!<br> 
        3.Photo 3: The dent â€“ Hereâ€™s what it looks like. It doesnâ€™t need to be even or deep, just a slight inwards curve, so the patty is shaped a bit like a red blood cell.<br>
        4.Tip #2 â€“ Salt JUST before cooking. My second key tip is to only salt the patty just before cooking. If you salt your patty ahead of time and leave it sitting around, the cooked patty ends up much firmer. This is because the salt acts on the meat proteins and changes their chemistry. Go ahead and give it a go, if you want to see it for yourself! ðŸ™‚ I salt mine while the skillet is pre-heating.<br>
